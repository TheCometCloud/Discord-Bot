# Discord-Bot
General Purpose Discord Bot

## Getting Started
First, you should install the requirements:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Additionally, if you want to use the youtube-dl feature, you'll need to install ffmpeg and add it to your environment variables.

In secret.py, set the `SECRET_KEY` variable equal to the bot account's token (don't commit after you've edited it).
